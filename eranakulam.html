              <p style="text-align:justify;" class="card-text">The Mattancherry Palace, also known as Dutch Palace, is one of the finest examples of the Kerala style of architecture interspersed with colonial influences. Located at around 12 km from Ernakulam, it was built around 1545 C.E. by the Portuguese as a present to King Veera Kerala Verma of Kochi dynasty. It came to be known as the Dutch Palace as it underwent major repairs at the hands of the Dutch. It is famous for its long and spacious halls along with its central courtyard. It is also the home of the deity of the royal family, Pazhayannur Bhagavathy (the Deity of Pazhayannur).

                This double storied palace has a lovely collection of murals. These depict some of the great Indian epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata along with revered Gods of the Hindu faith like Lord Krishna of Guruvayur Temple. The great works of Sanskrit poet Kalidasa have also been depicted. The mural paintings cover an area of almost 300 sq. km. One gets an idea of the lives of the royal family with some of the other exhibits. These include the life-size portraits of the Kings of Cochin since 1864, sheathed swords, daggers and axes besides ceremonial spears decorated with feathers. Royal caps, coins issued by the Kings of Cochin along with plans laid out for Cochin by the Dutch can also be viewed here.<a href="login.html"><b>Login</b> </a> to book a trip</p>

                  <p style="text-align:justify;" class="card-text">Vypeen , an island about five km from Ernakulam city, sprawls in an area of more than 25 km. It owes its origin to the heavy floods of 1341.

                    Till the advent of the Portuguese in the 16th century, the island was inhabited by a small indigenous fishing community. The Portuguese introduced Catholic faith in the area. They set up many churches including the famous Church of Our Lady of Hope.
                    
                    The Pallipuram Fort was also built by the Portuguese in this island.
                    
                    According to recent research, the Portuguese legacy is still visible in the dialect of a few Anglo-Indians in Vypeen. They use the earliest forms of Creole (a mixture of two-three languages) of the Portuguese language but its grammar is influenced by Malayalam.
                    
                    Under the influence of the Portuguese, Vypeen began to develop and is now one of the islands with the highest density of population. Today, the Goshree bridge connects the island to the city of Kochi  whereas earlier one had to be ferried to and fro. Njarakkal is the business centre of Vypeen.
                    
                    There are many unexplored spots in the island that are of interest to tourists. The lighthouse at Ochanthuruthu, with its adjacent beach, is one of them.<a href="login.html"><b>Login</b> </a> to book a trip</p>

                  <h5 style="text-align: center;" class="card-title">PARADESI SYNAGOGUE</h5>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;" class="card-text">Enter the synagogue and the large main hall arrests your attention with display of rare antique objects that add to the grandeur of the place. The light falling through the large open windows make the sight of chandeliers and lamps more delightful. These glass chandeliers dangling from the ceiling belong to the 19th century and were imported from Belgium.

                    The floor of the synagogue itself is a showpiece with the paving of hand-painted blue willow patterned floor tiles. These ceramic tiles were brought from Canton, China in the 18th century by Ezekiel Rahabi, a renowned Jewish businessman. Each tile is different from one another in its design and it never fails to capture the admiration of the visitors. The marvellous construction of the synagogue is revealed in all its features including the splendid pillars.
                    
                    A pulpit with brass rails is built in the center of the room. An exclusive gallery for women with gilt columns, a carved teak ark etc can be seen in the synagogue.  The teak Ark houses four scrolls of Torah (the first five books of Old Testament) and they are encased in silver and gold. Two gold crowns presented to the Jewish Community by the Kings of Kochi and Travancore are also kept here.<a href="login.html"><b>Login</b> </a> to book a trip</p>
