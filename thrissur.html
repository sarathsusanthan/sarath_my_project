              <p style="text-align:justify;" class="card-text">The Padmanabhaswamy temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital of Kerala, India. The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Malayalam translates to "The City of Lord Ananta", (The City Of Lord Vishnu) [1] referring to the deity of the Padmanabhaswamy temple. The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura.[2][3] While the Ananthapura temple at Kumbla in Kasaragod is considered the original seat of the deity ("Moolasthanam"), architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar.[4]

                The principal deity Padmanabhaswamy (Vishnu) is enshrined in the "Anantha Shayana" posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the infinite serpent Adi Shesha.[5] Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the royal family of Travancore. The titular Maharaja of Travancore, Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma, is the trustee of the temple. <a href="login.html"><b>Login</b> </a> to book a trip</p>

It is around 20km from Nagercoil, 39km from Kanyakumari town and 52 km from Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala.[1] The palace is complex inside with an old granite fortress around four kilometers long. The palace is located at the foot of the Veli Hills, which forms a part of the Western Ghats. The river Valli flows nearby.[2] Another palace known as Kuttalam Palace is situated in Kuttalam in Tenkasi district, Tamil Nadu which is also under the ownership of Kerala government. It is situated in the Tenkasi District, Tamil Nadu (before state reorganisation, Kanyakumari District, Chenkottah Taluk, Tenkasi Taluk including the areas of Kuttalam are in the control of Travancore Kingdom in Kerala).
